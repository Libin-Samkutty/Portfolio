        <p>Congratulations on embarking on a new journey! You've done it, and you have now completed the first step toward financial freedom, which is getting a job/paid internship.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In my opinion, everyone's goal should be to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Build an interest/passion in what you're doing.</strong>
                <br>You might be starting your career in a field in which you're already interested, which is great. However, many people begin their careers in a field they think might be suitable for them, but in hindsight, it may not always be the case. It's fine to get off on the wrong foot because it will help you at least go beyond the ground level. If you want to keep moving up the same ladder, it is necessary to be prepared for what's coming. You will have your ups and downs, but the only thing that will help you move forward is your interest and passion in the field. You need to build your interest in the field you've chosen, and even though it might be difficult, keep pushing through.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Personal Advice:</strong> Give at least 90 days to see if the path you've chosen is right for you. Understand the domain, gain some exposure to what's generally expected from people in the field, and try to stay informed about what's going on around you. At the early stages of your career, you need to be ahead of the curve, and it's like a vehicle that can only be fueled by your interest. After 90 days, if you still feel terrible and your mind isn't at where your heart is, you can start exploring different routes. 
                <br><br>
                <p class="note"> The 90-day timeframe isn't fixed, and it might take you longer or even less to determine whether you can build interest in your domain. Simply put, my intention is for you not to get discouraged and quit your job just because you think it isn't your cup of tea.
                </p></li>
            <li><strong>Become financially independent.</strong>
                <br>Not many are fortunate enough to earn a living from their passion. No matter how much we convince ourselves of the fairy tale notion of following our dreams because it brings us joy and satisfaction, it is also very important to have a stable and sufficient source of income to support ourselves and our families. This holds true for most people, and pursuing what we love is a blessing, but it is also a fact that we can achieve financial stability from a job that may not always align with our passion. This doesn't mean we have to abandon our dreams; it simply indicates that we should find a balance. A steady income allows us to enjoy life, provide for our loved ones, and even invest in our passions on the side. During my short career, I have observed many people earning a sizable amount of money but still burdened by debt and stress due to their financially risky lifestyles.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Personal Advice:</strong> Do not indulge in any form of debt, whether it be credit cards or "pay later" apps, until you've understood your financial appetite. Finance is very subjective, and there's a reason it's called “personal finance.” While there are general principles, such as budgeting, saving, and investing, I find it challenging to give any specific advice without knowing someone's mindset or current financial conditions. However, one piece of advice that I believe could be applicable for everyone is to avoid taking any form of loans or credit cards for at least one year after securing a stable income. It may seem fascinating to generate a CIBIL/Credit score and maintain a high score for easy access to loans, but please do not focus on this right from the start. It is very easy to get into the spiral or quicksand of debt, but very difficult to get out of it. Instead, focus on your skills and learning in the first year of your career rather than rushing to build a credit profile, which can eventually be built easily over time.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Final Thought:</strong> There are many things to keep in mind as you start your career, such as developing your soft skills or building a professional network. However, I believe these two points are particularly important and often get overlooked. You can put in your effort and find what works best for you, but I believe it's crucial to work towards these two diligently.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Best of luck!</p>
